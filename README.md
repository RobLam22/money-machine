# All A.I.

All A.I. is a powerful tool that users can utilize to save hours of work. Using A.I., you are able to write unique and engaging content. The responses will be different each time!

The goal is to streamline your workload.

This project was motivated by the Age of Artificial Intelligence. We are trying to harness the power of A.I. to help our streamline peoples workflows!

Also, making a little bit of cash on the side also helps through our subscription model. We tried to integrate both Stripe and OpenAI APIs into this project.

## Experience

The Website can be accessed here [Insert Netlify Link](https://www.github.com/RobLam22)

The website loads with a homepage that describes to the user what the website does and aims to achieve. Through A.I. we are able to prompt the user for some inputs that will return to them a detailed answer from A.I. There are several different tools at the users disposal, but the user must first create an account.

Some of the features that our website can do is:

- Article Generator
- Blog Post Writer
- Grammar Fix
- Keyword Suggestions
- Product Descriptions
- Sentence Expander
- Sentence Rewriter
- Social Media Post

All the users responses from A.I. can be saved and added to their Entries page. Which should list all the responses that were previously saved by the user.

## Features To Come

- Light/dark mode toggle
- More robust navigation
- More powerful A.I.

## Final Thoughts

- "Su Insert stuff here" - Su

"I really wanted to try to grasp all the React functionality in this project. Can I say I left this project with a solid understanding of React? No? Can I say I built a React app from the ground up? Yes with an asterisk.

Maybe it's the imposter syndrome kicking in but I felt like this project I was always out of my element from start to finish. There is a sense of acheivement of completing the project, this project has really highlighted that this career choice is always going to be a learning experience. Room for growth, existential fulfillment perhaps.

All jokes and cander aside, I really enjoyed working on the project with a dream partner like Su. It really made things easy and although we worked together previously, this just really highlighted the positives of working in a team." - Rob
